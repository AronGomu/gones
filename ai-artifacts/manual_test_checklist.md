- [ ] Signed in, open the home menu (`/`): a "Mes inscriptions" card appears between the Calendar card and the Settings card, with the description "Consultez les tournois auxquels vous êtes inscrit et annulez une inscription."
- [ ] Click that card: it navigates to `/registrations`.
- [ ] On `/registrations`, a "Retour au menu" button sits above the page title and a second one below the last section; both go back to the home menu.
- [ ] On `/registrations`, there is no "Compte" kicker above the "Mes inscriptions" title.
- [ ] Each registration card still shows its organization name ("Gones") above the tournament title — that kicker must survive.
- [ ] Sign out, open `/`: the "Mes inscriptions" card is gone.
- [ ] Signed out, navigate straight to `/registrations`: you are bounced to `/login`.
- [ ] Switch the app language to English in Settings and reload `/registrations`: the card description and the return buttons read in English, with no missing-key placeholders.
- [ ] At 375px width, `/registrations` has no horizontal scrollbar and both return buttons stay reachable.

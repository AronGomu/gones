# Manual test checklist — things a human must click that no automated test covers.

## T22 registrations-page-polish

- [ ] Signed in, open the home menu (`/`): a "Mes inscriptions" card appears between the Calendar card and the Settings card, with the description "Consultez les tournois auxquels vous êtes inscrit et annulez une inscription."
- [ ] Click that card: it navigates to `/registrations`.
- [ ] On `/registrations`, a "Retour au menu" button sits above the page title and a second one below the last section; both go back to the home menu.
- [ ] On `/registrations`, there is no "Compte" kicker above the "Mes inscriptions" title.
- [ ] Each registration card still shows its organization name ("Gones") above the tournament title — that kicker must survive.
- [ ] Sign out, open `/`: the "Mes inscriptions" card is gone.
- [ ] Signed out, navigate straight to `/registrations`: you are bounced to `/login`.
- [ ] Switch the app language to English in Settings and reload `/registrations`: the card description and the return buttons read in English, with no missing-key placeholders.
- [ ] At 375px width, `/registrations` has no horizontal scrollbar and both return buttons stay reachable.

## T23 backend-archive-rename

- [ ] After `docker compose run --rm migrator database update`, the existing archived Leagues are all still listed by `curl http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/leagues-archive` — the rename must not have lost a row.
- [ ] `curl http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/leagues` returns 404, and so do `/api/leagues/{id}` and `/api/leagues/{id}/export`: there is no alias for the old paths (ADR 0022).
- [ ] `curl http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/leagues-archive/{id}/tournaments-archive/{tournamentId}` returns the tournament, while the same URL with `/tournaments/` returns 404.
- [ ] Signed in as Organizer, create a League through the UI: the request goes to `/api/leagues-archive` and the `Location` header comes back as `/api/leagues-archive/{id}` (check the browser Network tab).
- [ ] Signed in as Organizer, download a League export and confirm the file still opens with `"kind": "league"` and a `"league"` object — the bundle format is frozen and must not mention "archive".
- [ ] Restore that same downloaded bundle through the restore screen: it is accepted and creates a new League. A bundle exported *before* this change must also still restore.
- [ ] Run a Live Tournament to the end and finalize it as Organizer: the response still carries a `leagueId`, and the finalized tournament shows up inside the target League Archive.
- [ ] Signed in as Organizer, open the player-name maintenance screen and commit a rename: it still works (its `/api/maintenance/player-names*` routes are deliberately not renamed, and its raw SQL now reads `league_archive_aggregates`).
- [ ] Calendar, sign-in/sign-up and the Admin dashboard are all unaffected — spot-check one page of each.
- [ ] Roll back check (optional, destructive — dev stack only): `dotnet ef database update AddTournamentProposals` puts the rows back under `league_aggregates` with no data loss, and re-applying restores them.
